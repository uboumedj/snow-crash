ls shows us a single binary, level07. When executed, it simply outputs "level07".
Let's try gdb like what we did a few levels earlier.

When digging in the disassembled code, I manage to understand that the binary simply
echoes the LOGNAME variable from the environment.
I check the environment, and indeed, we have a LOGNAME="level07" line.
Let's change that to something more suitable to us.

	export LOGNAME="; getflag"

level07 now magically shows us the flag:
