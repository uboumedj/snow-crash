As hinted in the introductory video, the password to connect to the flag00 account
is hidden in a file that can only be ran by the flag00 account.

Conveniently, a command exists for that:

	find /usr -user flag00

The result shows only one file: 

	/usr/bin/john

When CATing this file, we obtain a string:

	cdiiddwpgswtgt

This string doesn't work as a password for flag00. Conveniently (again), another hint
can be found in the introductory video. In the advised tools to complete the project,
the website dcode.fr is mentioned, which automatically decrypts simple encryptions like
the Caesar Cipher.
When trying to decrypt the previous string with their Caesar Cipher decrypting tool,
we get the following string:

	nottoohardhere

Which makes more sense, and magically works as the password for the flag00 account.
