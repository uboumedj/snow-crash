Doing a ls command in the level02 user directory displays one file!

	level02.pcap

A simple research tells me it's a packet capture file, that I can open and analyse
with a network protocal analyser. I chose and installed Wireshark (the subject
advises cloudshark but it seemed less user-friendly)

First, I have to get the file with the exact same method as the one I used on level01
for the /etc/passwd file.

	scp -P 4242 level01@192.168.0.37:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap .

Now that I have the file, I can open it with Wireshark and analyse the TCP stream.
One of the lines seems interesting:

	Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

The password with the dots doesn't seem to work! Luckily enough, it doesn't take me long
to guess that the points mean the delete button was pressed. Following this logic,
the password I end up getting is:

	ft_waNDReL0L

Which takes me to the flag02 account, where I use getflag to obtain the next level's
password:
