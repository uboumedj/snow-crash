There is one file in the directory: level11.lua, which is a lua script file.
It seems to run a server on the 5151 port of localhost. Testing it with netcat:

	nc localhost 5151

it's waiting for a password. Let's take a closer look at the script's code!
It seems to wait for the password for a minute; when it gets the password it hashes it
with sha1sum, then compares the result with a string (the hashed version of the expected password I guess).
Whether it matches or not doesn't actually matter, in both cases it just outputs a message
("Erf nope.." if it's the wrong one, "Gz you dumb" if it's correct).

The interesting part seems to reside in the hashing part of the code. It uses the io.popen
function, which basically executes its argument as a program. Here it executes the command
'echo "..pass.." | sha1sum', so basically it echoes the user's input and pipes the output
to the hashing program.
With the way it's called, I can simply inject any command I want by simply escaping the echo
with a ";". Let's try that:

	; getflag > /tmp/token

The program obviously doesn't accept the password and tells me "Erf nope...", but as I expected,
I can now find the token inside /tmp/token:
