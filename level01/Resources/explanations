/etc/passwd is a file that is accessible by any user and contains, among other things,
a list of users and their matching passwords. The actual passwords are usually hidden
in another file (/etc/shadow), and are only displayed in the passwd file with an "x";
but conveniently, on our current system, one line seems to have been neglected:

	flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

The password part is 42hDRfypTqqnw, but obviously it doesn't work as a password, or
it would have been too easy.

Here's where a small program advised in the subject becomes useful: john (the ripper).
John is an open source tool that basically decrypts hashed passwords by autodetecting
the password's hash type. I downloaded it from its official website:

	www.openwall.com/john

But first, we must get the passwd file out of the system. As we can connect to it by ssh,
it's fairly simple with the scp command:

	scp -P 4242 level01@192.168.1.17:/etc/passwd .

The command pulls the password file into the current directory. We can then run john
very simply:

	john passwd

The program automatically detects the hash type to be DES and decrypts it:

	abcdefg

Which works well as the flag01 password! The getflag command finally gives us the flag
for the next level:
