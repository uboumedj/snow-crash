Two files in the current directory: level09 and token. level09 is a binary that
takes an argument and seemingly outputs some gibberish; and token contains a character
string.

As it is, the character string inside token doesn't work as a password (it contains
weird symbols anyway)! Using level09 on its contents makes it even weirder.
The binary seems to be performing some kind of encryption on its argument. It doesn't
take me long to understand its nature.

	./level09 token
	tpmhr
	./level09 1111
	1234
	./level09 aaaaaa
	abcdef

It seems to shift each character by its index in the string. I can only assume that the
token has been "encrypted" with this method. Reversing it is super easy.

I create a small python script with vim, in /tmp/script.py

import sys

for i, char in enumerate(sys.argv[1]):
        sys.stdout.write(chr(ord(char) - i))
sys.stdout.write("\n")

Running the script on the token's contents gives me flag09's password.

	python /tmp/script.py $(cat token)

Now that I'm inside flag09, a simple getflag will give me the answer I'm looking for:
