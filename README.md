# School 42 Security project (beginner): Snowcrash

The given .iso contains 30 users (*level00* to *level14* + *flag00* to *flag14*). The goal is to find a way to access the current level's flag account
(i.e. *flag00* for *level00*). From there, the given command **getflag** will give us the password for the next level.

I only worked through the first 12 levels, the last one were bonuses.

## Principles involved

* Advanced shell scripts
* System and environment security flaws
* Security flaws in usual C stdlib functions
* gdb (GNU debugger)
* ASM, lua, perl and php
